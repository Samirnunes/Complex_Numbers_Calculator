# Complex_Numbers_Calculator
 Project made for the Udemy's course: Python 3 COMPLETO: Do iniciante ao avan√ßado. It consists in a complex numbers calculator (sum, division, multiplication, conjugate, argument, modulus and cis form). It was very important to me, because with it I learned about static methods in Python's classes.
